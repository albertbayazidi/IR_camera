### IMPROVMENTs 
-----------------

Change every double to float.

make use of preprocess for both x and y. can mabye be done by using transpoed.

In preprocessX we can make it more general by removing the hardcoding of the size of the matrix. 
    - Not as easy as it seems.
    - there are two diffrent matrices and some need to be hardcoded, 
    - I have used the ones that need size on compiletime, so cant have there be a dymanic value
    - will be alot to change. (better to do it right next time)

remove temp_readings when project is finished

### BIG IMPROMENT 
-------------------
Do all matrix multpilcations as one big matrix mutplication.
    - Not as easy as I first thought
    
Implement it in sparse maner.
